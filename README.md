What design process did you follow for your project work?
For this project, I followed a structured design process:
1.	Planning – I defined the goal: to animate a walking stick figure using OpenGL.
2.	Setup – I initialized a rendering window with GLFW and GLAD.
3.	Prototyping – I used basic shapes to build and visualize the figure.
4.	Animation – I applied time-based functions (glfwGetTime and sin) for leg motion and movement across the screen.
5.	Refinement – I adjusted speed and leg swing for smooth motion and ensured proper screen clearing to avoid duplicate drawings.
6.	Modularization – I prepared the code structure for future expansion, like multiple figures or adding textures.
7.	This process kept the project organized and easy to test and improve.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
     The tactics I used, such as breaking the project into smaller components, utilizing time-based animation for smooth motion, and organizing code into modular files, can be applied to future graphics or game development projects. These approaches improve scalability, make debugging easier, and allow for reusability. For example, using time-based logic ensures consistent animation speed across different machines, and modular design allows new features (like multiple characters or 3D movement) to be added with minimal changes to existing code.
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
     I begin by clearly defining the program's goal and breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. I start with setting up the environment and building a simple prototype to test the core functionality. Then, I gradually add features, test frequently, and refine the code for clarity and efficiency. I prefer a modular design so I can reuse code and make updates more easily. Throughout the process, I focus on logic first, then on visuals or user experience.
How did iteration factor into your development?
     Iteration played a key role in my development process. I started with basic functionality—drawing a static stick figure—then tested and refined the animation step-by-step. I adjusted variables like speed and leg swing through trial and error to create smooth motion. Each time I ran the program, I reviewed the result and made improvements, whether it was fixing visual glitches, adjusting frame timing, or simplifying code. This cycle of testing and refining helped me build a more polished and functional animation.
     How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones that led you to the project’s completion?
Throughout the milestones, my coding approach became more structured and efficient. Early on, I focused on getting things to work, but over time, I began organizing my code into functions and separate files to improve readability and maintainability. I learned to test smaller parts of the program before adding new features, and I started using time-based logic to make animations smoother and frame-rate independent. By the final milestone, I was confidently applying modular design, iteration, and real-time debugging to complete the project more effectively.
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
     Working with computational graphics has improved my understanding of how math, code, and visuals come together in real time. I gained skills in using coordinate systems, transformations, and animation techniques that strengthen both my logic and creative thinking. These skills are directly applicable to future courses in game development, computer vision, or simulation. They’ve also helped me become more confident in debugging graphical output and designing interactive visual systems, which are essential in many computer science and engineering fields.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
     Computational graphics and visualizations have taught me how to turn data and logic into visual, interactive results. I’ve developed skills in real-time rendering, animation, and spatial reasoning, which are valuable in fields like software development, game design, simulation, and user interface engineering. These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving ability and my understanding of performance optimization, both of which are essential for building responsive and visually effective applications in a professional setting.
